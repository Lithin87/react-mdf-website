<h3 style="color: blue">Existing Scenario :</h3>
<ul>
 <li> Sometimes  have requirements to test a developed artifact using a huge set of data each unique but adhering a particular schema.</li> 
 <li> They need a continuous flow of data simulating a Client Source system with variable speed set by us.</li> 
 <li> Previously the SDET  team have to be allocated and they may have a Project Managers and Test Leads to coordinate and then take days
 to prepare  huge number of tests data taking a considerable valuable amount of employee and time. </li> 
</ul>
Resources utilized 
<ul>
  <li>Test Engineers</li>
  <li>Test PM</li>
  <li>Days of effort</li>

<h3 style="color: blue">Usage & Future way of accessing Utility Tools :</h3>
<ul>
 <li> This tool helps in avoiding that by generating infinite set of unique JSON payload messages by taking as input any one of below </li> 
  <ol>
    <li> An Avro schema of the required message structure..</li> 
    <li> A sample JSON message provided by the source client. </li> 
  </ol>
 <li> Additionally, it enables us to simulate a functioning client system for end-to-end testing. . </li> 
 <li> This helps developers to test their developed code instantly without taking help or waiting for testers.  </li> 
 <li>  Furthermore, it can serve as a stress testing tool for most of our performance requirement.  </li> 
 <li> We can customize the range of values to be picked for generating the messages and offers the flexibility to send these generated messages to various destinations.   </li> 
 <li> These destinations include databases in on-premises or cloud environments, as well as HTTP URLs such as websites, AWS functions, running VMs or container images, cloud functions, and more.  </li> 
</ul>

<h3 style="color: blue">Key Features of the Mimic Data Framework(MDF)  :</h3>
<ul>
 <li> <b>URL based browser GUI interface : </b> 
  This interface of the type “user citizen” integration way . No local installation is required need software installation 
</li> 
 <li> <b>Minimal Cost : </b> 
  The tool menu is hosted on GCP Cloud Run, with 2 million requests free. The main workload compute VM is provisioned on-demand and can be deleted once the work is completed.
</li> 
 <li> <b>Container as a Service : </b>
  The main business logic workload is containerized within multiple container images. This speeds up the provisioning of virtual machines, making them rapidly available to developers within a few minutes for them to utilize its services.
</li> 
<li> <b> Use-Case defined Options : </b> 
   The options available in the tool are all designed in a single clicks button GUI for required services and only the minimal html text elements are provided for getting all the required inputs from the developers to start the services.
</li> 
</ul>
